# Metamorph Change Log

## Metamorph 1.0.1

First patch of Metamorph mod.

This patch doesn't really add stuff, rather it improves `1.0` release based on some of my thoughts and people's input from comments on PMC, PM, mails and mod reviews.

This patch adds few configuration options, improves GUIs, fixes some bugs and improves some morphs and rendering of the hand (thanks to [Blockbuster's mod](https://github.com/mchorse/blockbuster/) hands code).

* Added acquiring **morph** overlay (replaced chat messages).
* Improved first-person hand rendering (will work even with shaders).
* Improved **Creative Morphs Menu**:
    * Added key shortcuts for scrolling:
        * Key `arrow-up`: scroll up a little bit
        * Key `arrow-down`: scroll down a little bit
        * Key `arrow-left`: scroll to top
        * Key `arrow-right`: scroll to bottom
    * Added dragable scroll bar
    * Fixed crash when morphing with no morph selected
* Improved **Survival Morph Menu**:
    * Added **demorph** key. There's no default key, so you'll have to set it up.
    * If `[` or `]` pressed with `shift` modifier, one morph will be skipped.
    * If `[` or `]` pressed with `alt` modifier, selection will go in the beginning or the end.
    * Press `[` or `]` will highlight menu even if cursor hasn't moved.
    * When pressing `enter` (apply morph), the **Survival Morph Menu** will disappear.
* Improved **morphs**:
    * Added `hostile` ability, to most of hostile **morphs** and for some neutral and animal **morphs**, making morphed players not hostile to hostile mobs.
    * Added `speed` property. Now some of the **morphs** (`Ozelot`, `EntityHorse` and `Rabbit)` run faster or (`VillagerGolem`) run slower.
    * Added `night_vision` ability to `Guardian`.
    * Increased range and accuracy of `potions` action (`Witch` morph, basically).
    * When a player morphs or pick ups a morph, popping sound effect is played
* Sound effects for `teleport` action was added

## Metamorph 1.0

Initial release of Metamorph mod. 

Metamorph mod is a **Minecraft** mod that allows players to morph into different vanilla creatures by killing them and getting their morphs (souls/ghosts/whatever). Heavily inspired by **Morph** (by iChun) and **Shape Shifter Z** (by zacuke) mods.

This version adds morphs to most of vanilla creatures.

    * **Hostile mobs**: Blaze, Creeper, Ghast, Guardian, Magma cube, Silverfish, Skeleton, Slime, Witch, Wither Skeleton, and Zombie *morph*.
* Added **abilities**: `fly`, `glide`, `water_breath`, `swim`, `water_allergy`, `sun_allergy`, `snow_walk`, `fire_proof`, `prevent_fall`, `jumping`, `night_vision`, `climb`, `ender`, `smoke`, and `hungerless` *ability*.
* Added **attacks**: `wither`, `poison` and `knockback` *attack*.
* Added **actions**: `potions`, `snowball`, `teleport`, `fireball`, `explode` and `jump` *action*.
* Added **Creative Morph Menu** (use `B` key to open)
* Added **Survival Morph Menu** (use `[` and `]` to select a morph and `enter` to apply)
* Added **ghost** (by picking up a ghost, you gain a *morph* into your **Survival Morphing Menu**)
