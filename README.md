# Metamorph

**Metamorph** (from *[Metamorphosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphosis)*) – a Minecraft mod for 1.10.2, which allow players to morph into different vanilla mobs. Heavily inspired by iChun's Morph mod and zacuke's Shape Shifter Z mod. 

## How to play


To morph into other creature, you must to acquire a *morph* first. To acquire a *morph*, you have to kill a mob, then a ghost of this mob will appear (that's a *morph*), and when you'll pick it up, you'll acquire a *morph*. Only vanilla**\*** mobs have their own morphs.

Once you have at least one *morph*, you're able to transform into that *morph*. Use "**[**" and "**]**" keys for advancing through the list of *morphs*. Use "**enter**" key for transforming into selected *morph*.

You retain your *morphs* even after death. In creative, you can select any available *morph* via "Creative Morph Menu" which can be opened by pressing "**B**" key in the game. 

The outer look of *morphs* are quite limited, so you cannot kill a child pink sheep and turn into a child pink sheep. Instead, you'll turn into a white adult sheep.

**\*** – vanilla mobs that are listed below.


## About morphs

Every *morph* you equip or apply grant you different look, size, and health capacity. Except those properties, every *morph* also has special *abilities*, *attack* and *action*. 

*Abilities* give special properties to *morphs*. **Chicken** *morph* will slowly fall and get no fall damage. **Spider** and **CaveSpider** *morphs* will be able to climb on the wall. **Bat** *morph* will be able to fly and has a night vision.

*Attack* is an effect which is applied onto attacked entity. For example, if you hit some entity while being in **CaveSpider** *morph*, your target will gain **poison** potion effect. If you'll hit an entity while being in **VillagerGolem** *morph*, you'll throw your target high in the air.

*Action* is a special ability that is triggered by "action key" (which is "**V**" by default). Examples: in **Rabbit** *morph*, you'll jump high; in **Creeper** *morph*, you'll explode like a creeper, and so on.

## Installation 

Install [Minecraft Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/), then go to 
[releases](https://github.com/mchorse/metamorph/releases) and download the 
latest stable version (not a pre-release) of jar file. Put it in minecraft's `mods` 
folder, and launch the game. 

After that, Metamorph mod should be installed and will appear in Minecraft's 
mods menu. If Metamorph didn't appear in the mods menu, then something went 
wrong.
